        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>ISHWAR NEMADE.<br>
           TE computer Engineering Student.<br>
           I am a 3rd-year student at Matoshri College of Engineering & Research Centre, pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering. I was first introduced to the Internet at a very young age. My dad brought We brought home our first PC, and I learned how to do a simple online search. I quickly surpassed my father's computer skills and later taught myself basic programming, web design, and graphic design. This experience sparked my passion for technology and the internet, which has continued to grow. I am excited to further my knowledge in this area through hard work.
           <br>
           I am just trying to extend boundaries of my knowledge.
